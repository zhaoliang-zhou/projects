Note there are 3 rows, 3 columns, and 2 diagonals &mdash; hence 8 sums total. For example:\n"," \n"," $$\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n"," \\hline\n"," 4 & 9 & 2\\\\\n"," \\hline\n"," 3 & 5 & 7\\\\\n"," \\hline\n"," 8 & 1 & 6\\\\\n"," \\hline\n"," \\end{array} $$\n","Here, all the rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15.\n","\n","#### Find a magic square using simulated annealing!\n","\n","* State space: All possible assignments of $1, 2, \\dots, 9$ to the $3 \\times 3$ grid.\n","* Function to minimize: Something which indicate how far the 8 sums (that is, the three row, three column, and two diagonal sums) are from the desired value of 15. \n","* Proposal transition: It works well to have the following two different types of transitions:\n","    - Pick two of the 9 sites and swap the values.\n","    - Pick two rows or two columns and swap them.\n","  \n","  That is, propose a transition by _either_ swapping the values in two sites *or* swapping two rows or columns.\n","  \n","Some details follow.\n","\n","#### Starting state\n","\n","Here is a simple way to create a random starting state. It almost certainly will not be magic!\n","\n","`np.random.choice(range(1,10), (3,3), replace=False)`\n","\n","#### Function to minimize\n","\n","The function to minimize is critically important. A good idea is to create a function that first calculates the 8 row, column, and diagonal sums. Then for each of these values, determine (in absolute) value, how far they are from 15. The return value can be the mean (or max) of these distances.\n","\n","#### Proposal transition\n","\n","It might seem sufficient to just swap entries around, but it turns out that it's easy to get stuck in a bad square for which no swap will really improve things. A better idea is to randomly either swap sites or swap rows/columns.\n","\n","* Swap sites: Pick two sites in the $3\\times 3$ grid and just flip the entries. For example, you could pick the (1,2) site to swap with the (3,3) site. That means,\n","\n","$$\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n"," \\hline\n"," 1&\\mathbf{2}&5\\\\\n"," \\hline\n"," 3&7&6\\\\\n"," \\hline\n"," 8&4&\\mathbf{9}\\\\\n"," \\hline\n"," \\end{array}\\rightarrow\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n"," \\hline\n"," 1&\\mathbf{9}&5\\\\\n"," \\hline\n"," 3&7&6\\\\\n"," \\hline\n"," 8&4&\\mathbf{2}\\\\\n"," \\hline\n"," \\end{array}\n"," $$\n"," \n","* Swap rows or columns: Pick two rows (or columns) and flip the rows/columns.
